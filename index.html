        <h1>WHO AM I?</h1>
        <p>
          Zone 6 born and raised, so Omeretta the Great is not excluding me.
          Growing up so deep in the city allowed me to see all sides of Atlanta,
          and meet all of its different people. A city in the trees, and a
          populous so diverse, it is impossible not to fall in love. After
          graduating from Grady High School
          <em>(now known as Midtown High)</em> I joined the Georgia Army
          National Guard to assist in paying for college at the University of
          North Georgia. I received a Bachelors of Science in Criminal Justice
          and a Paralegal Certificate from the University of Georgia.

          Graduate of the

          program. This bootcamp has provided me strong knowledge of GitHub,
          HTML, CSS, the princibles of UI/UX, Javascript and now React. Pushing
          forward I am always seeking to practice what I have learned and gain
          more skills!

        <h1>Why am I?</h1>
        <p>
          Although my initial plan was to work in the legal field, as many
          mid-twenties and older people know, things don't always go according
          to plan. After five years in the legal field I decided it was time to
          move on. It was not what I expected, and not an environment I
          personally thrive in. Tech, on the other hand, has always been an
          interest of mine, and after talking over with friends who are on all
          different sides from management to back end, it was time for me to
          make the jump to something that truly interested me, and pushes me to
          become better.
